  As I user,
  I want to perform off-line AD on a SIEM data registered by Wazuh on date YYYY-MM-DD.

  Assuming: trained detector with unique identifier `uuid` available.

  1. Access C&C server
  2. Access ADBox
  3. Add an use-case file `siem_mtad_gat/assets/drivers/uc_x.yaml` including

      ```

      prediction:
          run_mode: "historical"
          index_date: YYYY-MM-DD
          detector_id: uuid
      ```
type: F
urgency: '4'
version: '0.1'
