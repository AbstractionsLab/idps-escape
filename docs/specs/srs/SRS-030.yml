  As a user,
  I want to read/plot AD results of training and test data.

  Assuming: trained detector with unique identifier `uuid` available.


  1. Access C&C server
  2. Access ADBox
  3. Open the folder `siem_mtad_gat/assets/detector_models/uuid/training`
  4. Use either external tools or viz-notebooks to visualize
     - train subset AD output: `train_output.pkl`
     - test subset AD output: `test_output.pkl`
type: F
urgency: '2'
version: '0.1'
