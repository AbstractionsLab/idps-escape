  As a user,
  I want to compare the outcome different anomaly detection algorithms on my data.

  Assuming: Two different algorithms A1 and A2 available in ADBox, and two compatible detectors D1 and D2 based on these algorithms, respectively.

  1. Access C&C server
  2. Access ADBox
  3. Establish detection parameters (time interval, features, etc.)
  4. Select a (trained) detector D1 using algorithm A1
  5. Run a prediction script using D1.
  6. Select a (trained) detector D2 using algorithm A2
  7. Run a prediction script using D2.
  8. Compare output using dedicated Dashboard.
