  As user,
  I want to add a new custom rule-set signature,
  to a specific network related event type.

  1. Access C&C server
  2. Add the file with custom rules `local.rules`
  3. Open `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` and update:

      ```
      rule-files:
          - suricata.rules
          - /path/to/local.rules
      ```
type: F
urgency: '1'
version: '0.1'
