  As a sys admin user,
  I want to enable host intrusion detection via pattern matching with known/expected threats (signature-based HIDS).

  1. Access host to be monitored.
  2. Deploy Wazuh Agent (using C&C manager ip).
  3. Enroll Agent agent.
  4. Set up local configs and logs.
  5. Possibly, define custom rules.
