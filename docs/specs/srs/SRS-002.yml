  As a system admin user,
  I want access end-point monitored system via IDPS-ESCAPE C&C server/unit,
  so that I can check the status of end-point monitor solutions deployed if any.

  1. Access C&C server as root.
  2. Via CyFORT-Wazuh manager, list the enrolled agents and their status.
  3. If deployed, check C-CyFORT-Suricata and mirroring status
  4. If any deployed, remote connect to endpoint and check local CyFORT-Suricata status.
