  As a user,
  I want to read/plot losses of training and test data.
  
  Assuming: trained detector with unique identifier `uuid` available.


  1. Access C&C server
  2. Access ADBox
  3. Open the folder `siem_mtad_gat/assets/detector_models/uuid/training`
  4. Use either external tools or viz-notebooks to visualize
     - train : `train_losses.png`
     - test : `test_losses.png`
