  As a user,
  I want to map a detected event to MITRE ATT&CK framework.

  1. Open the document corresponding to the event (e.g. via index query, or using the dashboard )
  2. Check if the following keys exist in the attributes
    ```
    rule.mitre.id , rule.mitre.tactic , rule.mitre.technique
    ```
