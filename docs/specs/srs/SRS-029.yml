  As a user,
  I want to detect anomaly by using both host and network events.

  1. Access C&C server
  2. Access ADBox
  3. Train a detector using features derived from CyFORT-Wazuh and CyFORT-Suricata logs arguments.
  4. Run a prediction script using the chosen detection either on a selected time interval or in realtime.
