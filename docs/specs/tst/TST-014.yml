  - The training should run for 10 epochs.
  - Train response should be seen on the console.
  - Training outputs and artifacts should be available in the `“/home/root/siem-mtad-gat/siem_mtad_gat/assets/detector_models/{detector_id}”` folder.
  - Prediction starts after training with message `“Predicting in historical mode.”`
  - Output screen should show message `“Could not establish a connection with OpenSearch.”`
  - And collect training data from default file with message `“The file '/home/root/siem-mtad-gat/siem_mtad_gat/assets/data/predict/wazuh-alerts-*.*-2024.07.22.json' does not exist, returning all default data.”`, depending upon the date it was run.
