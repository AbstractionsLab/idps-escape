    "# Endpoint resource monitoring via ADBox\n",
    "This notebook contains the visualization of results generated by the ADBox by executing one of its usecases. This notebook is designed to present the results of training the anomaly detection model and its subsequent results during prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "This use case illustrates the development of an anomaly detector for identifying irregularities in CPU and memory usage on a Linux endpoint. Monitoring Linux resources is paramount for optimizing performance and safeguarding the security of an organization’s data and network. Ensuring the health of a computer system is essential for the efficient provisioning of its services, which can be achieved through an overview of the state of its resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Metric data, which can be generated on every endpoint using various utilities, provides critical insights into resource utilization. \n",
    "Wazuh is a platform capable of collecting and indexing this endpoint metric data which would be used as input data for the ADBox. \n",
    "\n",
    "When monitoring Linux endpoints, four primary metrics should be considered: CPU usage, CPU load, memory utilization, and disk usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU Usage:** This metric represents the percentage of time a CPU spends executing non-idle tasks. Monitoring CPU usage helps in identifying how intensively the CPU is being utilized for processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU Load:** This metric measures the number of processes awaiting or utilizing CPU time at any given moment. Unlike CPU usage, CPU load provides a measure of the average number of processes that are either actively using or waiting to use CPU processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Utilization:** This refers to the percentage of available memory currently in use by the system or running applications. Monitoring memory utilization is crucial for identifying servers that are either underused or overused, allowing for effective load redistribution and memory optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disk Usage:** This metric indicates the percentage of disk space that is currently in use. Monitoring disk usage is vital for preventing potential data loss, reducing endpoint lag, and avoiding disk failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to performance optimization, monitoring these metrics plays a crucial role in enhancing system security. Unusual patterns or anomalies in resource usage can be indicative of security threats, such as malware infections or other malicious activities. \n",

    "## Prerequisites and Guidelines \n",
    "This notebook is designed for visualizing the results of anomaly detection using ADBox, not for executing the ADBox itself. To successfully visualize the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure ADBox Training and Prediction Outputs: Complete the training and prediction processes with ADBox separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide File Paths: Supply the notebook with the file paths where the ADBox output files are stored. These file paths are necessary for the notebook to access and display the results accurately.\n",

    "## ADBox \n",
    "ADBox is a custom anomaly-based intrusion detection component used in the IDPS-ESCAPE system. The ADBox integrates with Wazuh to detect anomalies in time-series data using the MTAD-GAT algorithm. It handles the ingestion, preprocessing, and evaluation of data collected by the SIEM. ADBox takes data from the events indexer, applies an anomaly detection model, and returns the results. Using MTAD-GAT (Multivariate Time-series Anomaly Detection via Graph Attention Network), a self-supervised learning framework, ADBox detects anomalies in multivariate time-series data through machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "It runs through the following stages which are the two fundamental stages of machine learning: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training Stage\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion:**\n",
    "During training, ADBox gathers time-series data from Wazuh. This data is used to teach the model how to identify normal patterns and distinguish them from anomalous behavior.\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "The collected data is preprocessed to ensure it is in a format suitable for training. This might include normalization, handling missing values, or reshaping the data.\n",
    "3. **Model Training:**\n",
    "The MTAD-GAT algorithm is applied to the preprocessed time-series data. \n",
    "4. **Visualization:**\n",
    "The notebook includes visualizations such as loss curves to illustrate the training performance and validate the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prediction/Detection Stage\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion:**\n",
    "For prediction, the ADBox ingests new time-series data from Wazuh. \n",
    "2. **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "The prediction input data is also preprocessed. \n",
    "3. **Anomaly Detection:**\n",
    "The trained MTAD-GAT model is applied to the data to detect anomalies. It uses the learned patterns from the training phase to identify deviations from expected behavior. The model provides predictions indicating whether each time window in the data is normal or anomalous.\n",
    "4. **Visualization:**\n",
    "Visualizations in this notebook include time-series plots with detected anomalies highlighted, anomaly scores over time. "
